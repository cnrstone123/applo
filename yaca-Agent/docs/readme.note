
Yet Another Call-graph Analysis Monitor, YACA
1.extract the downloaded zip.
2.run bat file
3.open browser with http://localhost:33333/
4.turn on switch option to "ON"
5.click "connect" button.
6.in java-applet, select one of 3-sort-categories and start it.
7.in java-applet, checks call-graph behavior.
99.when exiting, 
    in "resmon.exe", 
	    checks listening port in network-monitor 
		with image-name="java.exe", pid=nnnn
	in "cmd.exe"
    checks listening port with 
	    D:\>netstat -ano | find ":33333"

(note) currPorts.exe http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/cports.html
(note) To not close the process, 
       just to diconnect the specified connection using currPorts.exe of nirsoft
       plz, read so-doc:

	       Yes, CP is a wonderful tool: 
		       CurrPorts.exe /close <Local Address> <Local Port> <Remote Address> <Remote Port> {Process Name} 
		   This would be the line: 
		       CurrPorts.exe /close * 56789 * * server.exe

pre-requite:
    look at docs: 
	    http://www.sw-engineering-candies.com/blog-1/extremely-fast-and-simple-webgl-motion-detector-to-rotate-3d-graphic 
    The algorithm is very simple, robust and extremely fast compared with classic face detection approaches.
	The code is based on: 
        Three.js (r76), 
        glfx.js and 
        JavaScript.  
    It is tested with Chrome (v50) and Firefox (v45) UNDER OS X. 
	and you may download the sources from GitHub. 

    fork the project on GitHub or download the zipped project from GitHub. 
	Open the project in Eclipse (Luna) and You should see something like this:
